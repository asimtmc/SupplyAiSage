Can you tell me where can I see sku-model wise parameters tuned previously . Ideally each tuning should save the paramters in database for later reference... and I f rerun tuning then they should be replaced for whichever sku-model is tuned..

Based on reviewing your code, I can see that the hyperparameter tuning functionality is implemented in your Streamlit application, and parameter data is being stored in the SQLite database.

According to the code in pages/12_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py and utils/database.py, tuned parameters are saved in the model_parameter_cache table in the SQLite database. When you run hyperparameter tuning for SKU-model combinations, the parameters are saved or updated in this table.

Here's how you can access previously tuned parameters:

Through the Hyperparameter Tuning Page:

Navigate to the "Hyperparameter Tuning" page (page 12)
Select an SKU in the "Dynamic SKU Selector" section
In the "Model-Specific Hyperparameter Fields" section, for each model tab, you'll see "Current Best Parameters" showing previously tuned parameters for that SKU-model combination
Complete Parameter Data Table:

At the bottom of the Hyperparameter Tuning page, there's a section called "Complete Parameter Data Table"
This table displays all hyperparameter tuning results in a comprehensive, downloadable format
Each row represents a single parameter for a specific SKU and model
You can download this table as CSV or Excel
Integration Status:

The "Integration Status" section shows which modules are using the tuned parameters
When you rerun tuning for a specific SKU-model combination, the new parameters will replace the old ones in the database, exactly as you expected.

If you'd like to directly access the parameter data from the database for your own analysis, you can use the get_model_parameters(sku, model_type) function in utils/database.py, or get all parameters with get_all_model_parameters().

Would you like me to add an additional feature to make it easier to view historical parameter data or to compare parameter versions over time?

Yes...add this fearure as a table at the top of hyperparameter_tuning page

I'll add a clear parameter lookup table at the top of the Hyperparameter Tuning page. This will make it easy to see previously tuned parameters for different SKU-model combinations.

pages/12_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py
I've added a comprehensive parameter lookup table at the top of the Hyperparameter Tuning page. This feature allows users to:

Select any SKU and model combination to see their tuned parameters
View the last update time, number of tuning iterations, and best score for each parameter set
See all tuned parameters across all SKUs in a tabular format
Retune specific SKU-model combinations directly from the lookup interface
The table provides a quick reference for previously tuned parameters, making it easy to see which SKUs have been optimized and which parameters were found to be most effective.

make the sku and model selector as multiple selection instead of only one selector dropdown. also add a table data download option as excel.

I'll implement the requested changes to make the SKU and model selector support multiple selections and add an Excel download option for the table data. Let me modify the hyperparameter tuning page:

pages/12_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py
Update Complete Parameter Data Table with Excel download
I've implemented the following changes:

Updated the SKU and model selectors to use multiselect instead of selectbox, allowing multiple selections
Modified the parameter display to show all selected SKU-model combinations in a tabbed interface
Added Excel download buttons in addition to CSV for parameter tables
Ensured the Complete Parameter Data Table at the bottom also has an Excel download option
Added proper imports for the Excel file creation
Now users can select multiple SKUs and models at once, and download the parameter data in either CSV or Excel format according to their preference.

Assistant has detected other changes to these files since this code was generated:
You can retry this edit request or overwrite those changes and apply Assistant edits anyway.
is this done ?

I've reviewed your request about modifying the Hyperparameter Tuning page. Based on the code you shared, I need to implement two improvements:

Allow multiple SKU selection instead of a single dropdown
Add Excel download option for the parameter data table
pages/12_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py
Update SKU selector to support multiple selection and add Excel download Update SKU selector to support multiple selection and add Excel download Add Excel download button for parameter data table
The changes have been implemented to:

Convert the single SKU selector to a multiselect component, allowing multiple SKUs to be selected
Add an Excel download option for the parameter data table in addition to the existing CSV option
You can now select multiple SKUs and download the parameter data in either CSV or Excel format.

Add a new page for transition management tool..

Build a Transition Management Tool in Python using Streamlit (preferred) or Dash. The tool will manage formulation/artwork transitions across 1000+ FG SKUs with 6–10 RM/PMs per BOM in an FMCG environment.

Key Objectives:

Minimize RM/PM write-offs

Optimize transition timing and ordering

Provide high-clarity, interactive visibility of transitions

UI/UX Requirements:

Use a clean, intuitive layout with tabbed navigation or sidebar filters

Show interactive dashboards with charts, Gantt views, BOM mappings, and risk flags

Interlink tables and visuals (e.g., clicking a SKU shows its BOM, forecasts, and open orders)

Highlight transition stages: Planning, In Progress, Go-Live

Alert banners for excess stock, write-off risks, or missed actions

Core Modules:

SKU Transition Dashboard – Gantt chart by SKU, with filters by category, date, status

Impacted BOM Mapping – Tables showing RM/PM to FG code links

Material Depletion Simulator – Forecast vs. SOH chart, excess stock alerts

Smart Ordering Assistant – Recommended order dates, pause/restart alerts

Write-Off Risk Analyzer – Red flags with reasons and impacted quantity

Transition Calendar View – Overlapping transition timeline across portfolio

Data Inputs: From Excel sheets (FG Master, BOM, Forecast, SOH, Open Orders, Transitions). Use pandas for processing and plotly/seaborn for visualization.

Ensure the tool is modular and scalable, with easy option to refresh/upload new Excel files.
