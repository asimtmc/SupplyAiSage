Comprehensive Forecasting Improvements
1. Enhanced Data Preprocessing
• Robust Outlier Detection: Implement Isolation Forest to identify anomalies more effectively than z-score/IQR
• Outlier Replacement: Replace detected outliers with rolling median values instead of dropping them
• Change Point Detection: Add PELT algorithm from ruptures library to identify structural breaks in time series
2. Advanced Feature Engineering
• Lag Features: Create lag features (t-1, t-3, t-12) to capture different temporal patterns
• Rolling Statistics: Add rolling means, medians, and volatility over multiple windows
• Seasonality Features: Implement Fourier terms to capture cyclical patterns
• Variance Stabilization: Apply Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson transformations
3. Improved Cross-Validation
• Rolling Window Validation: Implement time-series cross-validation with incrementing training windows
• Multiple Evaluation Points: Test models at different points in time series history
• Robust Metrics: Calculate MAPE, weighted MAPE (wMAPE), and RMSE at each validation point
• Cross-Validation Framework:
• Split data into training, validation, and test sets using time-based splits
• For each model type, conduct k-fold time series cross-validation
• Average performance across folds to reduce selection bias
4. Model Enhancements
• ARIMA Improvements: Expand parameter space and use AIC/BIC for model selection
• Advanced Prophet: Fine-tune changepoint_prior_scale and seasonality parameters
• XGBoost Integration: Train gradient boosting models using engineered lag features
• Croston's Method: Implement for intermittent demand patterns
5. Ensemble Strategy
• Weighted Averaging: Combine forecasts with weights based on cross-validation performance
• Stacking Approach: Train a meta-model (Ridge regression) to optimize the combination of base forecasts
• Model-Specific Weighting: Apply higher weights to models that perform better for specific SKU characteristics
6. Background Hyperparameter Tuning
• Implementation Approach:
• Create a separate cache system for storing optimized parameters
• Use a background process to periodically optimize model parameters
• Store results in database for quick retrieval during forecasting
• Specific Technique:
• Implement threading with Python's concurrent.futures for parallel processing
• Use ThreadPoolExecutor to run hyperparameter tuning jobs in background
• Create a parameter cache table in the database with columns for SKU, model_type, parameters, and last_updated
• Add a scheduler that triggers optimization jobs during low-usage periods
7. Process Improvements
• Modularized Code: Create separate modules for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training
• Progress Tracking: Implement callback functions to report on tuning and forecast progress
• Error Analysis: Add detailed logging of model errors to identify problematic SKUs
